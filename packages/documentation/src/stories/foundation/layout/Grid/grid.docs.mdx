# Grid

The Grid splits the available space into 12 columns. Element are added to the Grid in such a way that their width is always a multiple of the column width.
Watch the illustrations on [the Experience Hub](https://www.experience-hub.ch/document/2803#/grundlagen/raster-und-abstaende/rasterdefinition) to get a better undersanding of what it could look like.

# Size

To set the width of the grid use the <code>col-[amount of columns]</code> class.
This specifies the amout of columns that the elemet will be using up.
You can set individual widths for different breakpoints.

For example asign <code>col-6 col-md-3 col-xl-2</code> to one element. This means that the element will be 6 columns wide up until the breakpoint <code>md >=780px</code> where it will start to only be 3 columns wide and for <code>xl >=1280</code> screens it will only be 2 columns wide.

# Gutters

Gutters handle the padding of the direct elements in the grid.

- <code>border-gutter</code>
- <code>vertical gutter</code>

# Gap

You can also add Margins inbetween the elements by using these classes.

- <code>gap-[1-5]</code> horizontaly & vertically <br />
- <code>row-gap-[1-5]</code> vertically <br />
- <code>columngap-[1-5]</code> horizontaly <br />

# Experience Hub

Read the guideines about grids in [the Experience Hub](https://www.experience-hub.ch/document/2803#/grundlagen/raster-und-abstaende/rasterdefinition)

There is no Grid with 6 columns for smaller screen in our system. Instead using the knowledge from above you can spcify multiple sizes to achive the same effect.

For example if an element should take up 2 columns on Desktop you would need to asign <code>col-4 col-rg-2</code> to comply with the design guidelines from the Expereince Hub.
